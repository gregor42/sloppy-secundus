This is a second experimental project.  That I have to make it through the web site is a let-down...

----
This is just a second project.
Mostly I'm just trying to create a new project from the command line
For the lulz..and the learning
Aaaand let me tell you - it was more painful than it should be.
I think that I need to make a TODO for a project to automate this process with a script that can be run from the command line.

I do however now grok the difference between how everyone ELSE perceives Branching & Forking and how Git users perceive it:
To the REST OF THE WORLD:
1. Branching means that you intend to merge back at some point in the future - and generally would rather donate a kidney
than to get involved in such an endeavor.
2. Forking means branching & just admitting that you're NEVER going to merge - and never trying to again.
To Git Users:
1. Branching and forking are actually ridiculously easy - so easy that we don't even differentiate between the two.
2. Forking is SO EASY - we do it ALL THE TIME
3. Forking is how Git users 'check code out'

It would seem that I have been naming these README files with the wrong file extension.... oops.
